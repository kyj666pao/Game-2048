The Game-2048 is a re-creation of the popular 2048. Tiles on the board can be moved by using the direction key on the keyboard. Tiles move following the direction and two tiles with the same number merge and add together. Each time when the direction key is pressed, it will generate a number 2 or 4 on the blank tile of the board. The goal of the game is to keep merging the number until reaches 2048 before all tiles are occupied by the number! When the player adds up to reach 2048, the player can challenge to reach a higher score!
