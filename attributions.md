## When I was making this Game-2048, there were some technical problems that I cannot figure out how to solve by myself. The articles below help me solve the problem. Thank you again!

- [Detecting the pressed arrow key](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-detecting-the-pressed-arrow-key/)
- [Create a 2D array of empty array](https://code.likeagirl.io/create-an-array-of-empty-arrays-7ec77edea546)
- [Check if two array is equal](https://flexiple.com/javascript/javascript-array-equality/)

I would like to say thank you to all of the authors of these articles that provide me with solutions.
